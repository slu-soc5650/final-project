## What is an Annotated Bibliography?
An **Annotated Bibliography** is one approach for documenting your research on a topic. It should be constructed using a thorough, systematic **literature search** of the [peer reviewed](https://library.sdsu.edu/research-services/research-help/peer-reviewed-articles) literature on your topic. We are interested primarily in the peer reviewed literature because we we want to understand the scholarly debate that has unfolded about our topic. The peer review process is also one indicator of quality. 

We typically think of peer review as falling into two categories - books and journal articles. While the process for reviewing books is different from articles, academic books are typically sent out for review before they are published by the publisher. Peer reviewed books are typically published by either a university press (e.g. Oxford University Press or The University of California Press) or by a publishing house that specializes in academic content (e.g. John Wiley & Sons).

Journal articles that are peer reviewed will be published in an academic journal. There are <a href="https://gmusocgrads.wordpress.com/development/journals/" target="_blank">many journals that publish sociological content</a>, along with others that publish more broadly in the social sciences (*Social Science & Medicine* is a great example). Be aware that not all journals are created equal - there is a whole group of so-called "predatory" journals (along with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/upshot/fake-academe-looking-much-like-the-real-thing.html" target="_blank">fake conferences</a>) that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/science/predatory-journals-academics.html" target="_blank">capitalize on the "publish or perish" culture of academia</a> as well as the relative isolation of many scholars in developing countries. While there are some lists of "predatory" journals, <a href="https://www.authoraid.info/en/news/details/1310/" target="_blank">learning how to evaluate *all* articles critically</a> is perhaps the best way to protect yourself against citing poor research.

## Conducting the Literature Search

### Analysis Development

With your research question in-hand (see "[Crafting a Research Question]"), you will want to follow a semi-structured process for identifying appropriate peer reviewed sources. Document the places you search and the search terms / key words you use in your research log. As you find sources, I recommend keeping track of them in a spreadsheet. This makes it easier to figure out if you have already found and downloaded an article that you may come across multiple times. <a href="http://www.raulpacheco.org/2016/06/synthesizing-different-bodies-of-work-in-your-literature-review-the-conceptual-synthesis-excel-dump-technique/" target="_blank">Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega website</a> has a great example of a spreadsheet used for tracking literature.

In one sheet of a spreadsheet workbook, keep track of the sources you've found, scanned (see "[Evaluating Sources]"), and found not to be useful. This is to serve as a reference later if you come across an article again and cannot remember if you already looked at it or not. You can easily generate bibliographic citations in Google Scholar by searching for the source and clicking the double quote icon under its Google Scholar entry (highlighted in red):

Clicking that icon should open a pop-up window that includes pre-formatted references in a number of different styles:

<img src="images/googleScholar2.png" width="274" />

I tend to use Chicago, which requires minimal editing for both books and articles to convert the citation to ASA (see "[Writing an Annotated Bibliography]" for an explanation about why ASA is used). For books, you'll want to move the year so that is referenced after the author's name and add the city and state before the publisher's name. For articles, you'll want to move the year and simplify the volume and issue numbers.

For sources that you find useful, enter them into a second sheet that includes a citation as well as how you found the article, what the major themes are, any notes you think you need on high-level details about the paper, and cross-references that indicate if the paper is cited by other papers you've found. These cross-references are important for making linkages between different aspects of the literature. 

### Process

I strongly encourage students to follow this general process for identifying appropriate literature:

1. **Identify appropriate search terms:** Based on your research question, what are the keywords that might help you find relevant articles?
2. **Identify the "state of the art":** Start by searching Annual Review journals (or similar, such as Sociology Compass) for recent articles that summarize the state of the literature in your area. You may not find an exact match, but you may find reviews of related topics. Use these articles to get a sense of what the "state of the art" is for your topic area(s).
3. **Citations from review articles:** Use the review articles you find to identify both seminal publications that define a field of study (may not be recent) as well as more recent empirical studies. Find and download these articles.
4. **Search other social science publications:** Whether or not you find helpful review articles, you will want to also search other key journals. Start with generalist journals and then move to more specific journals focused on particular types of research. Use the same search terms described above. In sociology, for example, the major generalist journals are *American Sociological Review*, *American Journal of Sociology*, *Social Forces*, and *Social Problems*. In one of my sub-fields, medical sociology, *Social Science and Medicine*, *Journal of Health and Social Behavior*, and *Health and Place* are all key journals.
5. **Search related journals:** Are there journals from other disciplines that are related? If so, search those as well using your search terms. In my research, the *American Journal of Public Health* and the *Annals of the American Association of Geographers* are both important journals from related disciplines.
6. **Search _Sociological Abstracts_:** If you are not finding many citations, you may want to search the Sociological Abstracts database, which catalogs many more sociological journals.
7. **Iterative Processing of Articles:** As you read through the articles you find and download in steps 3 through 7, seek out the studies that they cite that seem related. Download them, read them, and identify more related studies that they cite, then start the process over. Also use this process to identify books. Google Scholar can be instrumental in providing listings of articles that cite a given source. 

If you are coming from outside sociology and working on a project that is rooted in your home discipline, you will have to alter the above process to match the key *Annual Review* journal or journals as well as the other major publication outlets in your field.

## Evaluating Sources
First, make sure what you've found is [peer reviewed](/what-is-an-annotated-bibliography.html). If you've found a report or a popular press article (something like Time Magazine), hang onto it if you think it provides helpful contextual background but it should not be part of your literature search. If you've identified a dissertation or a thesis that seems helpful, there are typically two things worth doing: (1) check to see if it has been published as an article or a book (sometimes you'll have to check out the author's CV if you can find it), and (2) use it to identify other peer reviewed materials.

<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/" target="_blank">Science Magazine</a> has a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper" target="_blank">great article</a> that describes how different academics read articles. If you look through their responses, you'll notice that few take a new article, read the abstract than read through the article cover to cover. Instead there are a variety of approaches to finding out the "meat" of the article quickly, without reading it in its entirety. Use this as a strategy for figuring out whether or not an article is a good fit for your project. 

Read the abstract, introduction, and discussion/conclusion sections to get a sense of the paper. Ask yourself if it makes a contribution to what you are researching. If it does, add it to your spreadsheet and fill out the necessary details. If it _does not_, add it to the "discard" list so you can find it later if you change your mind (or if you forget whether you've read it or not!). You can find some more details on the "AIC" technique for reading on <a href="http://www.raulpacheco.org/2017/01/finding-the-most-relevant-information-in-a-paper-when-reading-a-three-step-method/" target="_blank">Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega's website</a>. He also has a <a href="http://www.raulpacheco.org/tag/reading-strategies/" target="_blank">reading strategies</a>.

If the article does fit into your research, take some basic <a href="http://www.raulpacheco.org/2017/05/writing-synthetic-notes-of-journal-articles-and-book-chapters/" target="_blank">synthetic notes</a> about the article. These will form the basis of your paragraphs for each source in the annotated bibliography.

## Writing an Annotated Bibliography

The annotated bibliography itself is a document that lists your sources in alphabetical order (or alphabetized within groupings for specific categories). Begin each entry with a full, properly formatted citation using the <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/using_research/formatting_in_sociology_asa_style/references_page_formatting.html" target="_blank">American Sociological Association (ASA) citation style</a>. 

I often get questions about whether students can use alternate citation formats. Different journals use different formats, so it is not possible for academics to learn and become comfortable with *just one* citation style. Rather, we use multiple citation styles regularly. Often, an article manuscript will be written in a specific citation style for one journal only to have to be reformatted in a different style for another journal if it is rejected on the first submission. Learning new citation styles quickly is therefore an important lesson, and one reason why ASA is the only citation style I accept for this project.

After the citation style, there should be one to two paragraphs summarizing the article and its importance for your project. The strongest annotated bibliographies will draw substantive or thematic connections between sources, noting which articles are cited by others and which articles share important connections. This will help you develop the synthesis your literature review section for the paper requires.
