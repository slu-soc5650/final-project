All students will select a data set and perform an original data analysis culminating in a series of maps displayed on an ArcGIS StoryMap. Overview Broadly speaking, all students will create an ArcGIS StoryMap to present a series of interactive maps about their chosen topic as well as approximately 800 to 1,000 words of narrative text providing some background, describing the maps, and drawing some basic, descriptive conclusions. You will be responsible for selecting a specific topic, cleaning their data, creating maps of their topic, and presenting the results. Students enrolled in SOC 5650 will also write a 3,000 word final paper in the style of an empirical journal article describing the academic literature your data are related to, how you prepared and mapped the data, and what you learned from your maps. How are these instructions organized? These instructions are organized into waypoints. These are meant to create “bite sized” modules that break down the final project into discrete phases. Each waypoint has a set of indicators on the top-level page for the waypoint that provide you with some general information about what the waypoint entails. These indicators will help you quickly navigate the instructions. What do I have to do? Each waypoint includes an indicator that describes what the goal of the waypoint is: Goal: create a quick summary of your project for Chris. The instructions will vary at different points based on whether you are enrolled in SOC 4615 or SOC 5650. Look for this indicator for information about who the waypoint is designed for: Personnel: This waypoint should be completed by all students. If the instructions are only for one of the sections, they will look like this: Personnel: This waypoint should be completed by students in SOC 5650 only. What do I need to know how to do? Some of the waypoint require technical skills that will be covered as the semester progresses. If that is the case, those meetings will be identified with this indicator: Skills: Meetings 1-1 and 1-2 When are vignettes due? Deadlines will be provided in an indicator at the top of each vignette that looks like this: Due Date: This waypoint must be completed by Meeting 3-1. What do I have to submit? All of the vignettes require you to produce something. A quick description of the deliverables associated with the vignette will be included in this indicator: Deliverables: A knit .Rmd notebook with the appropriate .md output that uses a literate programming approach to document your data cleaning efforts should be included in your final project repository. Data Analysis is not Linear The organization of these instructions implies a linear path - complete one vignette and then go on to the next. I want to remind you that data analysis is never a linear process. You are going to have to iterate over waypoints, often several times. You’ll perhaps do some initial data cleaning and move onto geoprocessing only to discover you need to alter how you’ve cleaned your data. So you’ll have to go back and do some additional cleaning. This process of iteration is the norm for data analysis. Even the most experienced analysts do this - it is not a function of inexperience so much as it is the nature of doing analytic work. One of the reasons that a plain-text approach to programming and statistics is so powerful is that this iteration becomes easy. You won’t have to remember the series of menu selections and check boxes you chose to produce a particular output as you would with a GUI-driven statistical application. Rather, recalculating descriptive statistics is as easy as making a small change to the source code for the data cleaning notebook, knitting that notebook, and then re-knitting the descriptive statistics notebook. Working in this way gives you the freedom to explore and experiment as much as you’d like! "],["license.html", "License", " License Copyright © 2016-2022 Christopher G.

"],["crafting-a-research-question.html", "1.1 Crafting a Research Question", " 1.1 Crafting a Research Question The process of conducting a research project starts with defining a research question to explore. For many students, this can be daunting. Yale University Sociology’s Handbook for Undergraduate Thesis research usefully breaks down the types of questions sociologists answer into three broad categories. I’ve provided these three categories below along with some sample research questions on undocumented immigration: “Questions about the meaning of certain activities, practices, or experiences for particular social groups.” “How do classmates respond when a student discloses that they are an undocumented immigrant?” “How does participation in an immigrant advocacy group effect undocumented immigrants?” “How does disclosing undocumented status change the treatment of immigrants in social services settings?” “Questions about the ways that identification with larger social categories – race, ethnicity, religion, political identification, gender – affect aspects of social life.” “What is the relationship between political conservatism and beliefs about immigration?” “How do views of immigration vary based on gender identity?” “What is the relationship between religiosity and support for undocumented immigrants?” “Questions about the influence of particular variables on other variables or outcomes, including questions that compare groups and track trends across a broader scale.” “What is the relationship between levels of education and employment for undocumented immigrants?” “How does racial segregation impact the outcomes of undocumented immigrants in cities?” “What is the effect of DREAMer status on educational attainment?” Each student should think about the overarching category they want to conduct research in. Like the research process as a whole (see “Data Analysis is not Linear”), you may find that crafting a research question is an iterative process. You’ll start with a broad topic, make a first attempt at narrowing it down, and then subsequently update the question as you find some related sources (and, if you are in SOC 5650, conduct a full-fledged literature review). Research questions for this course will be necessarily descriptive - “what is the spatial distribution of x?” "],["the-crime-data.html", "1.2 The Crime Data", " 1.2 The Crime Data The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department (SLMPD) is the primary law enforcement agency for the City of St. Louis.

They should numerous - there should be at least several hundred observations that vary over space and, ideally, over time as well. Several thousand observations will be ideal. They must be countable - the number of 9-1-1 calls, restaurants, or terrorist attacks, for example. They should be point data (or have the ability to be mapped as point data). Examples would be cities throughout a country or a region, restaurant locations across a city, state, or province, and crime scene locations. They should be able to be aggregated up to some sort of higher order construct. Think about how restaurant locations could be aggregated up to neighborhoods, municipalities, or counties. 1.5.2 Other Considerations There are a few other considerations to take into account. If you are a graduate student and have already identified a possible thesis topic, you may want pick a data set that is either a possible candidate for inclusion in your thesis or, at the very least, is conceptually related. You want to maximize the impact that your coursework has, so even if you are not sure whether or not the data set itself will be helpful, picking something in the same topic area will mean that your literature search can be put to use on future assignments (such as in your Research Methods course). 1.5.3 Pandemic Considerations I am normally flexible about accepting other data sets for the final project. However, because of the nature of the Spring 2021 semester, I am going to be more stringent in approving these. If you want to petition use an outside data set, you may. However, you need to be prepared to do some of the leg work on your own without the benefit of in-person support from Chris. 1.5.4 Finding an Appropriate Data Set In general, you are free to use any resource to identify a suitable data set that meets the above criteria with a couple of caveats: There is not time for you to collect your own data. There is not time for you to go through the IRB process to gain access to confidential data (either data that is not publicly available or data collected by a thesis adviser or other faculty member). The data you use should be licensed for re-use (it cannot be proprietary or otherwise restrictively licensed). The data should be well documented - you want to be very sure what each variable represents. If there is no code book or documentation, the data set is probably not appropriate for this project. See Chris if you have questions about this. "],["the-memo.html", "1.6 The Memo", " 1.6 The Memo Once you have completed all of the steps for identifying a suitable data set and outcome variable, you should create a new issue on your final project repository. In your issue: State what your research question is, identify the data you are using to address that question, and the main category within the data you would like to map. If you are petitioning to use a different data set, please clearly note this in your memo and we can discuss your proposal in greater detail.

"],["what-is-an-annotated-bibliography.html", "2.1 What is an Annotated Bibliography?", " 2.1 What is an Annotated Bibliography? An Annotated Bibliography is one approach for documenting your research on a topic. It should be constructed using a thorough, systematic literature search of the peer reviewed literature on your topic. We are interested primarily in the peer reviewed literature because we we want to understand the scholarly debate that has unfolded about our topic. The peer review process is also one indicator of quality. We typically think of peer review as falling into two categories - books and journal articles. While the process for reviewing books is different from articles, academic books are typically sent out for review before they are published by the publisher. Peer reviewed books are typically published by either a university press (e.g. Oxford University Press or The University of California Press) or by a publishing house that specializes in academic content (e.g. John Wiley &amp; Sons). Journal articles that are peer reviewed will be published in an academic journal. There are many journals that publish sociological content, along with others that publish more broadly in the social sciences (Social Science &amp; Medicine is a great example). Be aware that not all journals are created equal - there is a whole group of so-called “predatory” journals (along with fake conferences) that capitalize on the “publish or perish” culture of academia as well as the relative isolation of many scholars in developing countries. While there are some lists of “predatory” journals, learning how to evaluate all articles critically is perhaps the best way to protect yourself against citing poor research. "],["conducting-the-literature-search.html", "2.2 Conducting the Literature Search", " 2.2 Conducting the Literature Search 2.2.1 Analysis Development With your research question in-hand (see “Crafting a Research Question”), you will want to follow a semi-structured process for identifying appropriate peer reviewed sources. Document the places you search and the search terms / key words you use in your research log. As you find sources, I recommend keeping track of them in a spreadsheet. This makes it easier to figure out if you have already found and downloaded an article that you may come across multiple times. Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega website has a great example of a spreadsheet used for tracking literature. In one sheet of a spreadsheet workbook, keep track of the sources you’ve found, scanned (see “Evaluating Sources”), and found not to be useful. This is to serve as a reference later if you come across an article again and cannot remember if you already looked at it or not. You can easily generate bibliographic citations in Google Scholar by searching for the source and clicking the double quote icon under its Google Scholar entry (highlighted in red): Clicking that icon should open a pop-up window that includes pre-formatted references in a number of different styles: I tend to use Chicago, which requires minimal editing for both books and articles to convert the citation to ASA (see “Writing an Annotated Bibliography” for an explanation about why ASA is used). For books, you’ll want to move the year so that is referenced after the author’s name and add the city and state before the publisher’s name. For articles, you’ll want to move the year and simplify the volume and issue numbers. For sources that you find useful, enter them into a second sheet that includes a citation as well as how you found the article, what the major themes are, any notes you think you need on high-level details about the paper, and cross-references that indicate if the paper is cited by other papers you’ve found. These cross-references are important for making linkages between different aspects of the literature. 2.2.2 Process I strongly encourage students to follow this general process for identifying appropriate literature: Identify appropriate search terms: Based on your research question, what are the keywords that might help you find relevant articles? Identify the “state of the art”: Start by searching Annual Review journals (or similar, such as Sociology Compass) for recent articles that summarize the state of the literature in your area. You may not find an exact match, but you may find reviews of related topics. Use these articles to get a sense of what the “state of the art” is for your topic area(s). Citations from review articles: Use the review articles you find to identify both seminal publications that define a field of study (may not be recent) as well as more recent empirical studies. Find and download these articles. Search other social science publications: Whether or not you find helpful review articles, you will want to also search other key journals. Start with generalist journals and then move to more specific journals focused on particular types of research. Use the same search terms described above. In sociology, for example, the major generalist journals are American Sociological Review, American Journal of Sociology, Social Forces, and Social Problems. In one of my sub-fields, medical sociology, Social Science and Medicine, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, and Health and Place are all key journals. Search related journals: Are there journals from other disciplines that are related? If so, search those as well using your search terms. In my research, the American Journal of Public Health and the Annals of the American Association of Geographers are both important journals from related disciplines. Search Sociological Abstracts: If you are not finding many citations, you may want to search the Sociological Abstracts database, which catalogs many more sociological journals. Iterative Processing of Articles: As you read through the articles you find and download in steps 3 through 7, seek out the studies that they cite that seem related. Download them, read them, and identify more related studies that they cite, then start the process over. Also use this process to identify books. Google Scholar can be instrumental in providing listings of articles that cite a given source. If you are coming from outside sociology and working on a project that is rooted in your home discipline, you will have to alter the above process to match the key Annual Review journal or journals as well as the other major publication outlets in your field. "],["evaluating-sources.html", "2.3 Evaluating Sources", " 2.3 Evaluating Sources First, make sure what you’ve found is peer reviewed. If you’ve found a report or a popular press article (something like Time Magazine), hang onto it if you think it provides helpful contextual background but it should not be part of your literature search. If you’ve identified a dissertation or a thesis that seems helpful, there are typically two things worth doing: (1) check to see if it has been published as an article or a book (sometimes you’ll have to check out the author’s CV if you can find it), and (2) use it to identify other peer reviewed materials. Science Magazine has a great article that describes how different academics read articles. If you look through their responses, you’ll notice that few take a new article, read the abstract than read through the article cover to cover. Instead there are a variety of approaches to finding out the “meat” of the article quickly, without reading it in its entirety. Use this as a strategy for figuring out whether or not an article is a good fit for your project. Read the abstract, introduction, and discussion/conclusion sections to get a sense of the paper. Ask yourself if it makes a contribution to what you are researching. If it does, add it to your spreadsheet and fill out the necessary details. If it does not, add it to the “discard” list so you can find it later if you change your mind (or if you forget whether you’ve read it or not!). You can find some more details on the “AIC” technique for reading on Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega’s website. He also has a reading strategies. If the article does fit into your research, take some basic synthetic notes about the article. These will form the basis of your paragraphs for each source in the annotated bibliography. "],["writing-an-annotated-bibliography.html", "2.4 Writing an Annotated Bibliography", " 2.4 Writing an Annotated Bibliography The annotated bibliography itself is a document that lists your sources in alphabetical order (or alphabetized within groupings for specific categories). Begin each entry with a full, properly formatted citation using the American Sociological Association (ASA) citation style. I often get questions about whether students can use alternate citation formats. Different journals use different formats, so it is not possible for academics to learn and become comfortable with just one citation style. Rather, we use multiple citation styles regularly. Often, an article manuscript will be written in a specific citation style for one journal only to have to be reformatted in a different style for another journal if it is rejected on the first submission. Learning new citation styles quickly is therefore an important lesson, and one reason why ASA is the only citation style I accept for this project. After the citation style, there should be one to two paragraphs summarizing the article and its importance for your project. The strongest annotated bibliographies will draw substantive or thematic connections between sources, noting which articles are cited by others and which articles share important connections. This will help you develop the synthesis your literature review section for the paper requires. For more, see Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega’s post on writing an annotated bibliography.

If you are using multiple computers, you can create empty text files named .gitkeep using RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; Text File) and keep one in each subfolder. Since you will be storing this repository on GitHub, you will be default be using version control for this project. You should make commits (like voting in Chicago!) early and often. Make sure that your commit messages are informative and clear. Remember, if you have to go back to an earlier version of your work, you will want to make it as easy as possible to do so. Also make sure that you are pushing to GitHub often and not just saving the work locally on your computer. This is part of your insurance against a catastrophic loss of your computer or a lab computer where you are working. You are strongly encouraged to use a more comprehensive backup solution! "],["project-planning.html", "3.2 Project Planning", " 3.2 Project Planning Use GitHub’s “Project Board” feature on your final project’s GitHub repository to plan out the tasks you need to complete. Create a new project and assign each waypoint to a column. Then assign specific tasks and deliverables related to that waypoint to individual notes in that column. As you progress through the project, keep this updated so that you can track your progress. You can read more about managing projects and tracking progress with a project board in GitHub’s documentation. "],["project-documentation.html", "3.3 Project Documentation", " 3.3 Project Documentation There are two project-level documentation files that you will need to create and keep updated throughout the semester. 3.3.1 README.md You will need a read-me file in the top-level of your assignment repository. There will already be a file named README.md in the top-level of your repository. Please edit this and modify it as needed! 3.3.2 RESEARCH_LOG.md You will need to maintain a research log throughout the final project process. Before proceeding with the waypoints, create a well-formatted and organized research log in RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; Text File) that is organized chronologically. The research log should use markdown syntax and be saved as a markdown file (.md). Keep this file updated and have it saved in the top-level of your assignment repository. For each day you work on the final project, there should be an entry that describes the work that you have done, what files you have created or modified, and how those modifications took place. Give as much detail as possible without directly replicating the notes you make in individual files using the literate programming approach. This will be particularly important for your mapmaking work in ArcGIS Pro, which is inherently not reproducible and thus good notes are imperative. Think of the research log as step-by-step instructions to yourself that would allow you to recreate all of your work should every final project file you work on be accidentally deleted or lost. For code, you can provide higher level details since, ideally, your literate programming approach means that your code is well annotated and described. For plots and your slides, you want to provide as much fine grained detail as possible down to specific font, color, and size choices for data and layout elements. "],["data-cleaning-overview.html", "3.4 Data Cleaning Overview", " 3.4 Data Cleaning Overview 3.4.1 Analysis Development All data cleaning should be done in a single notebook that you clarify and expand over time. Use dplyr, naniar, janitor, and sf for data cleaning in short, well-organized pipelines. 3.4.2 General Approach The amount of data cleaning needed will vary significantly based on the data set you are using and the measures you have selected. Thus there are no “one size fits all” instructions for cleaning your data, though you should follow the data cleaning workflow we discussed in class. In general, you will want to focus on making sure a number of criteria are met: Variables should have short, clear, intuitive names. All missing data have been recoded to NA values (if they were not already coded that way). If your data set does not include identification numbers for each row, you will need to create them. The tibble package’s rowid_to_column() function can be used for this. Only columns necessary for mapping should be included - subset out all other columns. Only observations necessary for mapping should be included - subset out all other observations (i.e. if you are using the crime data, subset out all crimes not in the category you are working with). You will also want to remove all duplicate observations. Identify and subset out data missing spatial references. In the crime data set, these will either be missing already (NA values) or have values of 0. In the CSB data set, these will either be missing already (NA values) or have values less than 800000 in the x coordinate and less than 980000 in the y coordinate. If you are using another data source, make sure there are no missing data. The indicators above are similar to the indicators you should look for. Remove observations in the crime data where the count is -1 and in the CSB data where there is a stats of CANCEL. If you are using another data, make sure there are no observations for invalid data, as in calls for service that were canceled or crimes that were removed from the data set. Clean and modify the values of specific observations as needed. For example if you have a category variable - which both the crime and CSB data do, make sure it returns short, clear values. If you have multiple categories in such a variable, create a new categorical variable that simply differentiates between the relevant codes. For instance, the following values are the focus of a sample project using the CSB data. These nine categories could be summarized as (1) stray animal, loose, (2) stray animal, contained, (3) animal surrender. Stray Animal | 4,102 0.57 83.25 Stray Animal Cntnd | 118 0.02 83.27 Stray Cat | 1,623 0.22 83.49 Stray Dog At Large | 9,036 1.25 84.75 Stray Dog Cntnd-ACC | 1,416 0.20 84.94 Stray Dog Contained | 939 0.13 85.07 Surrender Cat | 18 0.00 85.84 Surrender Dog | 23 0.00 85.84 Surrender Pet | 151 0.02 85.86 For projects using a non-standard data set: You want to follow the same general process as above. You should have point data, though they may come as .csv or .shp data. If they were obtained from a geodatabase, export them to .shp and then import them into R. If you need to geocode the data (i.e. you have address or city identifiers but no spatial data for them), see Chris to discuss this process.
