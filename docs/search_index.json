"],["crafting-a-research-question.html", "1.1 Crafting a Research Question", " 1.1 Crafting a Research Question The process of conducting a research project starts with defining a research question to explore. For many students, this can be daunting. Yale University Sociology’s Handbook for Undergraduate Thesis research usefully breaks down the types of questions sociologists answer into three broad categories. I’ve provided these three categories below along with some sample research questions on undocumented immigration: “Questions about the meaning of certain activities, practices, or experiences for particular social groups.” “How do classmates respond when a student discloses that they are an undocumented immigrant?” “How does participation in an immigrant advocacy group effect undocumented immigrants?” “How does disclosing undocumented status change the treatment of immigrants in social services settings?” “Questions about the ways that identification with larger social categories – race, ethnicity, religion, political identification, gender – affect aspects of social life.” “What is the relationship between political conservatism and beliefs about immigration?” “How do views of immigration vary based on gender identity?” “What is the relationship between religiosity and support for undocumented immigrants?” “Questions about the influence of particular variables on other variables or outcomes, including questions that compare groups and track trends across a broader scale.” “What is the relationship between levels of education and employment for undocumented immigrants?” “How does racial segregation impact the outcomes of undocumented immigrants in cities?” “What is the effect of DREAMer status on educational attainment?” Each student should think about the overarching category they want to conduct research in. Like the research process as a whole (see “Data Analysis is not Linear”), you may find that crafting a research question is an iterative process. You’ll start with a broad topic, make a first attempt at narrowing it down, and then subsequently update the question as you find some related sources (and, if you are in SOC 5650, conduct a full-fledged literature review). Research questions for this course will be necessarily descriptive - “what is the spatial distribution of x?” "],["the-crime-data.html", "1.2 The Crime Data", " 1.2 The Crime Data The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department (SLMPD) is the primary law enforcement agency for the City of St. Louis. These data comprise all crimes reported by SLMPD for a five year period between 2015 and 2019. 1.2.1 License These data have been published without an explicit license. However, since they are the work of a government agency, they are considered in the public domain and are therefore available for reuse. 1.2.2 Download You can download these data from GitHub. Please read the README.md file carefully to learn which file you should use. 1.2.3 Topic Categories If you want to select a topic from these data, you should pick one crime category below. For example, you might pick Arson or Vandalism. 1.2.3.1 Part 1 Crimes According to the FBI, Part 1 crimes are serious crimes: These offenses were chosen because they are serious crimes, they occur with regularity in all areas of the country, and they are likely to be reported to police. With the exception of arson, data on these crimes has regularly been collected and reported by the FBI on a national basis since 1930. Arson was added to the list of Part 1 crimes (also known as “Index” crimes) in 1979. ucr category 1 Homicide 2 Rape 3 Robbery 4 Aggravated Assault 5 Burgalry 6 Larceny 7 Motor Vehicle Theft 8 Arson 1.2.3.2 Part 2 Offenses Crimes that are so-called “Part 2” offenses are typically less serious and may not be felonies. ucr category 9 Other Assaults 10 Forgery and Counterfeiting 11 Fraud 12 Embezzlement 13 Stolen Property 14 Vandalism 15 Weapons 16 Prostitution and Commercialized Vice 17 Sex Offenses 18 Drug Abuse Violations 19 Gambling 20 Offenses Against the Family and Children 21 Liquor Laws 22 Drunkeness 23 Disorderly Conduct 24 Vagrancy 25 All Other Offenses 26 Suspicion 27 Curfew and Loitering Laws-Persons under 18 28 Runaways-Persons under 18 "],["the-citizens-service-bureau-data.html", "1.3 The Citizens’ Service Bureau Data", " 1.3 The Citizens’ Service Bureau Data The Citizens’ Service Bureau (CSB) is a clearing house for the City of St. Louis. Requests for service come primarily from residents or business owners in the City through the CSB’s website or by phone. Other City agencies also put requests for service into the CSB, and they take requests via fax, email, and Twitter.

They should numerous - there should be at least several hundred observations that vary over space and, ideally, over time as well. Several thousand observations will be ideal. They must be countable - the number of 9-1-1 calls, resturants, or terrorist attacks, for example. They should be point data (or have the ability to be mapped as point data). Examples would be cities throughout a country or a region, resturant locations across a city, state, or province, and crime scene locations. They should be able to be aggregated up to some sort of higher order construct. Think about how resturant locations could be aggregated up to neighborhoods, municipalities, or counties. 1.4.2 Other Considerations There are a few other considerations to take into account. If you are a graduate student and have already identified a possible thesis topic, you may want pick a data set that is either a possible candidate for inclusion in your thesis or, at the very least, is conceptually related. You want to maximize the impact that your coursework has, so even if you are not sure whether or not the data set itself will be helpful, picking something in the same topic area will mean that your literature search can be put to use on future assignments (such as in your Research Methods course). 1.4.3 Pandemic Considerations I am normally flexible about accepting other data sets for the final project. However, because of the nature of the Spring 2021 semester, I am going to be more stringent in approving these. If you want to petition use an outside data set, you may. However, you need to be prepared to do some of the leg work on your own without the benefit of in-person support from Chris. 1.4.4 Finding an Appropriate Data Set In general, you are free to use any resource to identify a suitable data set that meets the above criteria with a couple of caveats: There is not time for you to collect your own data. There is not time for you to go through the IRB process to gain access to confidential data (either data that is not publicly available or data collected by a thesis adviser or other faculty member). The data you use should be licensed for re-use (it cannot be proprietary or otherwise restrictively licensed). The data should be well documented - you want to be very sure what each variable represents. If there is no code book or documentation, the data set is probably not appropriate for this project. See Chris if you have questions about this. "],["the-memo.html", "1.5 The Memo", " 1.5 The Memo Once you have completed all of the steps for identifying a suitable data set and outcome variable, you should create a new issue on your final project repository. In your issue: State what your research question is, identify the data you are using to address that question, and the main category within the data you would like to map. If you are petitioning to use a different data set, please clearly note this in your memo and we can discuss your proposal in greater detail. Once you have your memo drafted, open the issue and assign it to Chris for review.
